# Fibonacci Based AES Encryption (FAES)

> It is aimed to strengthen the algorithm in terms of cryptography by   using the AES encryption algorithm with fibonacci polynomials.   
The project was developed as a windows desktop application using C# programming language.  
Text, txt files and images can be encrypted and decrypted.
___

## Methods of Algorithm
* Encryption
  * Plain text -> Encrypted text
  * .txt file  -> .faes file
  * Image file -> Encrypted image file  
    Supported extensions of image:
    * .png
    * .jpg
* Decryption
  * Encrypted text -> Plain text
  * .faes file -> .txt file
  * Encrypted image file -> image file  
    Supported extensions of image:
    * .png
    * .jpg
