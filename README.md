# Fibonacci Based AES Encryption (FAES)

> It is aimed to strengthen the algorithm in terms of cryptography by   using the AES encryption algorithm with fibonacci polynomials.   
The project was developed as a windows desktop application using C# programming language.  
Text, txt files and images can be encrypted and decrypted.
___

## Methods of Algorithm
